* 10 (?) I didn't track this, and spend more time than I needed to on

* String for addTerm)

/**********************************************************************
 * The most difficult part of the assignment was trying to determine
 * what exactly was required. In particular, Words and Prefixes were
 * explained especially poorly and explained 2 different ways, (so I 
 * chose the easier implementation) which led to a lot of frustration
 * and me building out a part of the project that was not needed and 
 * wasting about an hour on it.

/**********************************************************************
 * Once I figured out what the requirements were, things were pretty easy.
 * I wish this project had been a bit more of a challenge, and it got to
 * be repetitive with me just continually writing recursive methods and adding
 * 1 or 2 lines. There was nothing super complex about it, and I think 
 * I would have been more challenged and learned more from last year's 
 * file compressor final project. 

 * Additionally, I think that grading (at least for the first part) was
 * somewhat unfair, as I was deducted points for making toString of 
 * Node recursive when nothing specifically says not to in the assignment.
